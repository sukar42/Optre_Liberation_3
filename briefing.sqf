// Objectivs

	[
		"Objectives and Tips",
			"
			<br/>
			PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:<br/>
			Your maingoal is to take Altis back from the URF.<br/>
			To do so you need to Capture at least the 7 Major Cities:<br/>
			Kavala, Athira, Pyrgos, Agios Dionysios, Zaros, Paros<br/>
			and Molos<br/>
			<br/>
			SECONDARY OBJECTIVES<br/>
			The more you capture of the Island, the more will the URF<br/>
			try to fight back<br/>
			To weaken their Reinforcements you have to destroy their<br/>
			Supplies!<br/>
			After capturing a Location check for Enemies that<br/>
			surrender and arrest them<br/>
			Then bring them back to a FOB to interrogate them!<br/>
			They may have Information about enemie FOBs and<br/>
			Supplies!<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			TIPS:<br/>
			To make Life easier capture different URF Bases, Towns<br/>
			and Factories you should also do optional Objectives.<br/>
			<br/>
			TOWNS: They give you Manpower, so you can deploy<br/>
			more and better Soldiers!<br/>
			MILITARY BASES: They will give you Ammo needed for<br/>
			Vehicles and Elite Units!<br/>
			FACTORIES: They produce Fuel wich is needed to keep<br/>
			Vehicles operational and to deploy them!<br/>
			<br/>
			Be warned! URF Troops will try to defend their Positions<br/>
			at all Costs and may call Reinforcements!
            <br/>
   If there are Radio Towers in the Sector you are<br/>
			operating in they will call enemy Reinforcements<br/>
   If you are able to capture Radio Towers, they will<br/>
			give you Intel about enemy Movement!<br/>
            <br/>
   If you want to survive always plan your Attacks<br/>
			and work as a Team!<br/>
